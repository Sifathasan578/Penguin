# Penguin

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS.

Learned: CSS Transforms. Using transforms one can transform HTML elements to create appealing designs that draw reader's eye. Transforms can be used to rotate elements, scale them, and more. I built a penguin. I used CSS transforms to position and resize the parts of your penguin, create a background, and animated my work.
